## Made a document in the main chain

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Read in Data

```{r}
# because this is within a folder i need to indicate the folder it is withing
energy <- read_csv("data/us_energy.csv")

```

## Create a line chart of evergy over time, with color based on energy type

```{r}
# type names() in console in order to see variable names so you can type correctly
ggplot(data = energy, aes(x = year, y = quadrillion_btu, color = type)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()
```

## OR

```{r}
# making a ggplot without the global direction where all lines follow the rule set
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = energy, aes(x = year, y = quadrillion_btu, color = type)) +
  geom_line(data = energy, aes(x = year, y = quadrillion_btu, color = type))
```
